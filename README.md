Here are links to two articles I wrote that fleshed out my skills in GGPlot. 

1. Visualizing Modern Changeup Usage - https://peterbarston.blogspot.com/2021/05/visualizing-modern-changeup-usage.html
I looked here to see how the changeup - one of the most effective but fickle pitches in the game - has been used over the past few years. 

2. Evolution of the Pitcher Max Velocity - https://peterbarston.blogspot.com/2021/06/fastest-pitch-evolution.html
Here I examined the well-known trend for harder and harder pitches the last few years.
